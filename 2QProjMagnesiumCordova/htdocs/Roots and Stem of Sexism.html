			<h3>Gender discrimination occurs across the community, even if it is not always apparent. Because of how much it has been normalized, it is quick to overlook. However, it is past time for us to act since it is for the best. Because such inequality affects everyone, we must identify the exact conditions in which the problem arises. Where does gender inequality stem from? What are the early signs of such discrimination?</h3>

			<p> Sexism starts in Childhood </p>

			<h3> Even at an early age, children are subjected to gender discrimination. Such instances of sexism are seen as normal by society. It is critical not to allow children to have that same worldview that they will have as adults. The unfair treatment and differing expectations for boys and girls based merely on gender is horrifically frequent. What's worse is that cartoons and children's books, the things that influence a child, can also display subtle sexism.</h3>

			<h3>Boys are frequently expected to display a masculine personality at all times. They are commonly given toys for "boys"; society considers it inappropriate for a young boy to play with dolls, like the color pink, or have hobbies that are dominated by girls, such as ballet or make-up. Knowing that you should only enjoy what society wants you to like is, of course, detrimental. As a result, there's a good chance they'll grow up with toxic masculinity. Where they believe that being feminine is considered weak. It leads to other mental problems, such as aggression.</h3>

			<h3> Furthermore, it might contribute to emotional issues in boys. Crying is considered as a sign of weakness and a "feminine" trait. Because boys are trained to be more "manly," it is usual for them to hide their emotions or, if they do not, to express them through aggressiveness. It also makes it more difficult for them to talk about their feelings. It is a major contributor to men's higher suicide rates. </h3>
			<h3> Little girls are subjected to the same, if not greater, pressure. Of course, society regards them as feminine, but when a female becomes overly feminine, she is viewed as weak. However, if they demonstrate masculinity, they are perceived as someone who seeks attention and affirmation from males. Furthermore, even when girls are young, they are taught home responsibilities and are expected to be proficient at them right away. They are expected to do the majority of the housework; boys are not subjected to the same expectation. Girls are pushed and expected to mature quickly.</h3>
			<h3> Girls are also more commonly assessed based on their looks. It increases the pressure on individuals who do not meet society's ideals of a slender physique with perfect proportions. People insist on speaking about a girl's weight or how much she eats, and they are trained to eat less from a young age. Of course, this stunts growth, but it also leads to a larger problem: eating disorders. It is difficult for a child to establish a positive body image and healthy eating habits when everyone makes them feel horrible about themselves. It is harmful both psychologically and physically. Little girls should not have to suffer as a result of society's attitudes.</h3>
