			<h3>Because gender prejudice begins at a young age, a large majority of people develop a sexist mentality as a result. It has an impact on how everyone in a community is treated. The fact is that it will only serve to strengthen a patriarchal culture in which men are regarded as more important and superior to women. Nonetheless, even men do not gain substantially from such a society. What kinds of gender discrimination do both men and women face?</h3>

			<p> In the Workplace </p>
			<img src="..\images\Workplace_.png">
			<h3> Most workplaces have a high level of gender discrimination. When employing personnel, it may have preconceived notions about a certain gender. According to International Labor Organization statistics, women have a labor force participation rate of 49 percent, while men have a rate of 75 percent. The disparity demonstrates how much women are undervalued in the labor market as compared to males. Furthermore, men are more likely to be employed in STEM fields, whilst women are more likely to be employed in nursing and caregiving positions. It is also a result of how society expectations and norms impacted one's job interests.</h3>
			<h3> Another kind of workplace discrimination is the gender wage gap. It refers to the wage disparity between men and women. Women in male-dominated jobs earn much less than comparably educated men in those occupations. Women may be less productive and have worse self-esteem as a result of such prejudice. </h3>

			<img src="..\images\Harrassment.jpg">
			<h3>Sexual harassment is another kind of gender discrimination. It could happen to anyone and at anytime.  Sexual harassment may occur even in crowded places where there are a lot of people. Cat calling on the streets, a stranger's discreet touching on public transportation, or perhaps another employee in the office getting too close. Data shows that around 81% of women and 41% of men have experienced some type of sexual harassment in their lifetime. It is difficult to avoid and is frequently treated lightly yet it shouldn't be.</h3>
			<hr>
			<p style="margin-top: 10px;"> Gender Roles </p>
			<img src="..\images\Roles_.png">
			<h3>Gender roles are how society expects us to act or behave based on our gender. Gender roles may be classified into several categories, including personality qualities, household habits, employment, and physical appearance. Women, for example, are supposed to be feminine, courteous, accommodating, and even competent at housework. Men are supposed to be muscular, powerful, aggressive, and to provide for their families. It is damaging because it makes it difficult for people to express themselves authentically. They will most likely be criticized if they are not raised the way society expects them to be.</h3>
